        Out here, we recommend only the gear and tools we’d trust in our own pack. Some of the links on Phoenix Creek Supply are affiliate links, 
        meaning if you click and buy, we may earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you.

        This helps keep the lights on, the coffee hot, and the site growing. We’re not in the business of pushing junk; if it’s here, it’s been 
        field-tested or comes from a brand we trust.

        Bottom line: you’re still responsible for choosing what’s right for you, your skills, and your situation. 
        Always use your head, double-check your gear, and don’t rely on us for common sense in the field.
